    "Stronger performance. Comparing `text-embedding-ada-002` to `text-embedding-3-small`, the average score on a commonly used benchmark for multi-language retrieval (MIRACL(opens in a new window)) has increased from 31.4% to 44.0%, while the average score on a commonly used benchmark for English tasks (MTEB(opens in a new window)) has increased from 61.0% to 62.3%.\n",

    "Reduced price. `text-embedding-3-small` is also substantially more efficient than our previous generation `text-embedding-ada-002` model. Pricing for `text-embedding-3-small` has therefore been reduced by 5X compared to `text-embedding-ada-002`, from a price per 1k tokens of $0.0001 to $0.00002.\n",

It is easy to set up and integrates well with various AI tools and algorithms. Chroma is particularly useful for applications that require rapid and precise retrieval of content represented as embeddings—efficient data formats for text, images, and soon, audio and video.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Integration with AI Tools:** Chroma supports embedding functions from leading providers like OpenAI, Google, and Hugging Face, allowing for flexible and powerful data handling.\n",
    "- **Ease of Use:** The database provides default embedding functions, or users can integrate external APIs to generate embeddings.\n",
    "- **Efficient Querying:** Users can create collections to store embeddings, documents, and metadata. These can be queried to retrieve the most similar items, making information retrieval quick and effective.\n",
    "- **Flexible API:** Chroma offers a straightforward API that supports both standard operations and custom embedding functions.\n",

It has been cultivated there for more than 5,000 years. It is prominently featured in many cuisines throughout the world. Some of them are Italian, Thai, Vietnamese and Laotian cuisines. It grows to between 30–60\\xa0cm tall. It has light green, silky leaves 3–5\\xa0cm long and 1–3\\xa0cm broad. The leaves are opposite each other. The flowers are quite big.

    "In many Q&A applications, the ability to engage in back-and-forth conversations with users is crucial. This necessitates the application having a form of \"memory\" to recall past interactions and apply this context to current queries.\n",

    "### Building on the Q&A RAG System - to a Conversational Q&A RAG System\n",
    "\n",
    "We will enhance our Q&A RAG System, which utilizes the Wikipedia dataset, by implementing the following updates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt Adjustment:** Our prompt will be modified to include historical messages as inputs, allowing the system to maintain context over the course of a conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contextualizing Questions:** We will introduce a sub-chain mechanism to reformulate the latest user query by considering the chat history. This is crucial for understanding questions that refer back to previous messages. For example, a query like \"Can you elaborate on the second point?\" relies on the context provided by preceding interactions, which affects the system's ability to retrieve relevant information effectively.\n",

    "## Contextualizing the Question\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain a seamless flow in conversations, especially in a Q&A setting, it's essential to incorporate historical interactions. Here’s how we achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Sub-Chain for Historical Context\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sub-Chain Creation:** We'll define a sub-chain that uses both historical messages and the latest user query. This sub-chain reformulates the question if it refers to any past interactions, ensuring the system, especially the vector database understands the context to return the most relevant documents to this newly reworded question.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using `MessagesPlaceholder`:** Our prompt construction involves a `MessagesPlaceholder` variable named `chat_history`. This setup allows us to input a list of messages using the `chat_history` key. The system integrates these messages, positioning them after its own responses and before the latest user question.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Helper Function Usage:** We employ the `create_history_aware_retriever` function available [here](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.history_aware_retriever.create_history_aware_retriever.html). This function is crucial for handling instances where the chat history might be empty and orchestrates the sequence of operations: `prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() | retriever`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Chain Construction:** The `create_history_aware_retriever` constructs a chain that processes inputs under the keys `input` and `chat_history`, ensuring the output schema aligns with that of a retriever.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these steps, our system can effectively utilize historical context to better understand and respond to user queries, thereby enhancing the conversational experience.\n"

    "## Building the QA RAG Chain with Chat History\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're ready to construct our comprehensive QA RAG chain, which leverages historical context for more accurate and relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of the QA RAG Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating Document Chains:**\n",
    "   - We use the `create_stuff_documents_chain` function, which is detailed [here](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.combine_documents.stuff.create_stuff_documents_chain.html). This function is used to create a `question_answer_chain`, accepting inputs such as `context`, `chat_history`, and `input`. It efficiently combines the retrieved context with the conversation history and the current query to generate an informed answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Building the Final QA RAG Chain:**\n",
    "   - The entire QA RAG chain is assembled using the `create_retrieval_chain` function, available [here](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.retrieval.create_retrieval_chain.html). This chain integrates the `history_aware_retriever` with the `question_answer_chain`. It retains intermediate outputs like the retrieved context for added convenience during the query handling process.\n",
    "   - The `create_retrieval_chain` function accepts keys such as `input` and `chat_history` and includes `input`, `chat_history`, `context`, and `answer` in its outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these steps, the system not only contextualizes but also provides accurate answers by synthesizing information from both the current and historical interactions. This method enhances the conversational AI’s ability to understand and respond to user queries dynamically, making the interactions more engaging and relevant.\n"
